NOTE TO T.A.: Daniel and I managed to receive 96% code coverage without the exception handling mechanisms. 
When we added the additional try/catch blocks, our code coverage decreased to 91%. We talked to Matt about
testing for exceptional cases (i.e. making the underlying socket throw some kind of exception), and he told
us not to worry about it, its mainly for our own good to visualize whats occuring on the server side (console). 
We just wanted to let you know so that you don't deduct points from our solution because the code coverage isn't
in the high 90's. If you uncomment the try/catch clauses I guarantee you'll find 96% code coverage.
